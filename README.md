# Recipe File System and Meal Planner

This was my group project for Software Development course.

Coding Chef is an online repository where members can create, store, and share their recipes for others to enjoy. The Coding Chef Team has provided users with a unique database of over 500 ingredients. Each of these ingredients comes with accurate cost and calorie estimates, allowing for users to gauge the price of their meal with the click of a button. Users can also choose to keep a recipe private, so your family recipes are safe with us.You can sign up and get started with your personal online cookbook today!


For the  implementation of backend database, we chose to use MySQL hosted on Azure. 
Node.js was chose as backend language because of its non/blocking I/O model and it is also applicable to many web technologies of today. 
For the frontend, we used handlebars because it is a very powerful templating engine, to which we can inject data in the form of variables from the backend so that they can rendered easily in the frontend.
